# What is Recursion in JavsSript?

## Recursion is when a function calls itself until someone stops it.
 If no one stops it then it'll
recurse (call itself) forever. Recursive functions let you perform a unit of work multiple times.
Modern programming languages like JavaScript already have the for and while statements as
alternatives to recursive functions. But some languages like Closure do not have any looping
statements, so you need to use recursion to repeatedly execute a piece of code.

# What is Closure in JavsSript?

## Closure-
A closure 
is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to
its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you
access to an outer function's scope from an inner function
